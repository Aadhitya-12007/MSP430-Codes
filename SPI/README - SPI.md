This schematic demonstrates SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication between two MSP430G2553 microcontrollers in a classic master-slave topology:

U1 (left): SPI master

U2 (right): SPI slave

Hardware Overview
SPI Signals

Master (U1) pins:

P1.5 (SCLK): SPI clock output

P1.7 (SIMO): Master-out, Slave-in (MOSI)

P1.6 (SOMI): Master-in, Slave-out (MISO)

P1.4 (STE): Slave select/chip select (SS)

Slave (U2) pins:

Same pin mapping for SCLK, SIMO, SOMI, STE (all signals directly connected to those of master)

SCLK from master to slave SCLK

SIMO from master to slave SIMO (data output from master)

SOMI from master to slave SOMI (data output from slave)

STE from master to slave STE (active low chip select)

Push-button and Switch Array

Master includes a push-button array; these generate events or data to send to the slave.

LED Indicators

Slave (U2) drives a green LED (D1) via a GPIO when commanded by the master, showing SPI output control.

Virtual Serial Monitor

RXD/TXD/RTS/CTS lines to a UART terminal, likely for debug or data display.

SPI Flow
Master Initiates Transfer:

When a button is pressed, the master prepares a data byte to send over SPI.

Master pulls STE (slave select) low, enabling communication with U2.

Master transmits SPI clock on SCLK while exchanging one or more bytes with the slave.

Slave Receives Command:

On every SPI clock edge, the slave shifts in bits from master (SIMO), and sends bits back on SOMI.

Received byte may trigger slave logic (such as toggling the LED, responding over UART, etc.).

Bidirectional Data:

SPI is full-duplex; while the master sends a command, the slave can reply or send status in the same transfer.

End of Exchange:

Master pulls STE high, disabling the slave.

Circuit Functionality
Master controls data direction, clock speed, and selects the slave.

Slave executes application logic based on received SPI bytes.
