This schematic demonstrates Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication between two MSP430G2553 microcontrollers in a master-slave configuration:

U1 (left): I2C master device

U2 (right): I2C slave device with LED indicator

Hardware Connections
I2C Bus Lines:

SCL (Serial Clock): P1.6 on both microcontrollers connected together

SDA (Serial Data): P1.7 on both microcontrollers connected together

Pull-up Resistor: R1 (10kÎ©) connected to the I2C bus lines and VCC, providing the necessary pull-up for open-drain I2C operation

Peripheral Components:

D1 (LED-GREEN): Connected to slave (U2) GPIO pin for visual feedback

Common Ground: Both microcontrollers share the same ground reference

I2C Communication Flow
Master Initiates Communication:

U1 (master) generates the clock signal on SCL

Master starts communication by sending the slave address on SDA

Master can send commands or data to the slave

Slave Response:

U2 (slave) listens on the I2C bus with a predefined address

When addressed, slave acknowledges and receives data

Based on received commands, slave can control the green LED (D1)

Bidirectional Data Transfer:

Master can write data to slave (commands, control signals)

Master can also read data from slave (status, sensor readings)

Key Features
Two-wire Interface: Only SCL and SDA lines needed for communication

Multi-master Capable: I2C protocol supports multiple masters (though only one shown)

Hardware Pull-ups: R1 ensures proper logic HIGH levels on the bus

Visual Feedback: LED provides immediate indication of slave activity
